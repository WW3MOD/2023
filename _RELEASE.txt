    - Dynamic Visibility implemented with Progressive Vision

Cover

    - Cargo / Enter

        - Auto Enter order, makes selected units go into nearest transport / makes transports call in nearby infantry

        - Use current behaviour for internal / protected slots

        - Add new mode that puts actors invisible on top of the cell of the Cargo Actor,
            this allows units to target either the building or autotarget the actor inside.

            -

    - Seek shelter order, makes units seek the highest possible cover near them
        multiple clicks increases search radius for controling how much they spread out

    - Protection based on cell type / overlaping actors footprint / proximity

Resources

    - Auto Capture for technicians as a "Weapon", making AutoTargeting work

    - Dynamic income based on structure health

    - Autoheals slowly if less than 50% damaged
        Heavy damage needs engineer to restore and
        Critical damage needs a special Repair/Construction Vehicle to bring in resources.

Flags

    - Place Flags all around the map edges, chain-linking control gives access to deploy troops there,
        broken chain makes Flags disabled for calling in reinforcements.
