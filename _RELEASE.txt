Flags
    - Place Flags all around the map edges, chain-linking control gives access to deploy troops there, broken chain makes Flags disabled for calling in reinforcements.

Resources
    - Auto Capture for technicians as a "Weapon", making AutoTargeting work
    - Dynamic income based on structure health
    - Autoheals slowly if less than 50% damaged
        Heavy damage needs engineer to restore and
        Critical damage needs a special Repair/Construction Vehicle to bring in resources.
    - Nuclear powerplant, releases long lasting radiation if destroyed

Production
    - Infinite build
    - Cancel all of a production type by right clicking icon
    - Set infinite build by adding in same production after finishing each unit
    - Pausing speeds up other production just as if it was cancelled (infantry)

Movements
    - Move in formation - Don't move away from group
        - Close, Default, Far, Range-Organized - longest ranged units at the back
    -

Attacking
    - Sweeping, shooting at multiple enemies within one burst
    - Suppression trait, always prioritize units not taking cover

Infantry
    - Attack move default / make infantry fire on the move
    - Sprint when force moving soldiers, disables firing on the move
    - Infantry can go over cliffs now
    - Adjust speed
    - E8 Desolator, looks like RPG ish
        - e8d (deployed) could work as a reloading sequence if the green color is changed
    - Remove Spy, Dog?
    - Engineer Repair and MineClearing doesn't work unless they have primary/secondary weapon name.
        - Different name works for C4, so can't see why it wouldn't work.
        - Solution now is to merge Vehicle/BuildingRepair to primary, MineClearing secondary, and the rest after that.
        - Actually, it seems like tertiary weapon doesn't work, is this for all units? Must one of the three be paused for the others to work perhaps? Because tertiary is a thing for many other units

Cover
    - Cargo / Enter
        - Auto Enter order, makes selected units go into nearest transport / makes transports call in nearby infantry
        - Use current behaviour for internal / protected slots
        - Add new mode that puts actors invisible on top of the cell of the Cargo Actor,
            this allows units to target either the building or autotarget the actor inside.
    - Seek shelter order, makes units seek the highest possible cover near them
        multiple clicks increases search radius for controling how much they spread out
    - Protection based on cell type / overlaping actors footprint / proximity
    - Trenches

Vehicles
    - Adjust speed
    - Firing rate adjustment after game speed was changed, perhaps slower
    - Tesla tank returns to base when out of ammo
    - Crystallized Doom tanks
    - GDRN, tracked drone vehicle

Air
    - Reduce Damage from small arms
    - Adjust speed
    - Helicopter movement, acceleration/deceleration
    - A10 freezes mid-air when out of gun-ammo and attack-moving with gun-only target in range
    - Tiberian Aurora Attack helicopter model, very nice almost too good

Ammo
    - Costs money
    - Trucks need to be sent back
    - Widget for auto rearm
    - Fix current behaviour of going to the waypoint, enter Supply Route instead and evacuate area
    - Units out of ammo rejects attack orders

Animations
    - TOS explosion effects
    - Projectiles "Disappearing" ouside northern edge
    - Colors are camouflage, not silly colors. Select from list instead, maybe even two colors. They could read half of the palette each?

Sounds
    - Voice
    - Firing
    - Explosions

Widgets
    - Move to edges, remove borders, free up space
    - Add stances, Autotarget priorities

Mines
    - Cloaking
    - Engineer demining

Add Ukraine faction

AI
    - Needs to learn to build Logistics centers and rearm
    - AutoAssign Actor Method
        - Single Actor can call this method to determine where to go, can be used by both AI and player as a stance. "Autoassign on idle"
    - Unit Builder Module
        - Looks at what enemy has.
        - Builds what is necessary, not just random.
        - Units define capabilities, and Builder Module determines what capabilities are needed.
    - Strategical Module
        - Designates targets and areas of interest. Oil, and where to defend/attack.
        - Designates new units to target locations and if needed transfers units between tactical groups.
    - Tactical Module
        - Coordinates units for each point of interest, spreads out and keeps a tactical formation.
    - Operational Module
        - Smaller squads move as one and attacks targets.
        - Individual units attack targets of high value etc.

End Game
    - Capturing enemy flag could start a countdown to victory so you cant have hidden units preventing victory and neglect your spawn
    - Time limited games ends with nuclear armageddon
        - Power "Nuclear escalation" that, if everyone uses it, the nuclear war begins with one nuke per player per 10s or something, game ends by points gathered before Armageddon
        - Everyone starts with a tactical nuke that counts down to the game end time, when it is reached anyone can fire but if they do they

- Shellmaps
    - "Bradley Square"
    - Piatykhatky Ukrainian offensive breakthrough

Div
    - Civ buildings give Base under attack notification
    - Buildings can have attack stance and that translates into what the default should be for units (that doesn't implement some kind of LockInitialStance Trait, or possibly OverrideAttackAllStance. Useful for spies I guess)
    - Spawn Aircraft/all units at full speed
    - Save last game settings and view a quick button to load the last one and also drop down

Futuristic
    - Shattered Paradise
        - Crusader infantry, mech suit
        - Animation militantfire, large fire TS.anim palette?
        - nahfact tall concrete building, looks like missile factory or something
        - armh vehicle, good tank chassis but needs rework
    - ACOL, cyber unit with laser...
