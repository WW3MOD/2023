Flags
    - Place Flags all around the map edges, chain-linking control gives access to deploy troops there, broken chain makes Flags disabled for calling in reinforcements.

Resources
    - Auto Capture for technicians as a "Weapon", making AutoTargeting work
    - Dynamic income based on structure health
    - Autoheals slowly if less than 50% damaged
        Heavy damage needs engineer to restore and
        Critical damage needs a special Repair/Construction Vehicle to bring in resources.
    - Nuclear powerplant, releases long lasting radiation if destroyed

Groups / Selection
    -

Production
    - Pause / Cancel all of a production type by clicking icon
    - Building same unit causes shortage (increased price/build time, then reduced by fixed amount for all units every X ticks until back to normal/minimal price)

    Ctrl - Prioritized Build
    Ctrl Shift - Build 5
    Alt - Toggle Infinite build for unit
    Alt Shift - Cancel all
    (combine with QWE... to build 123...)

Infantry
    - Attack move default / make infantry fire on the move
    - Sprint when force moving soldiers, disables firing on the move
    - Adjust speed
    - E8 Desolator, looks like RPG ish
        - e8d (deployed) could work as a reloading sequence if the green color is changed
    - Remove Spy, Dog?
    - Engineer Repair and MineClearing doesn't work unless they have primary/secondary weapon name.
        - Different name works for C4, so can't see why it wouldn't work.
        - Solution now is to merge Vehicle/BuildingRepair to primary, MineClearing secondary, and the rest after that.
        - Actually, it seems like tertiary weapon doesn't work, is this for all units? Must one of the three be paused for the others to work perhaps? Because tertiary is a thing for many other units
    - Protection, add new mode that puts actors invisible on top of the cell of what is now the Cargo Actor,
        this allows units to target either the building or autotarget the actor inside.
        Use current behaviour for internal / protected ("Cargo") slots

Vehicles
    - Adjust speed
    - Firing rate adjustment after game speed was changed, perhaps slower
    - Tesla tank returns to base when out of ammo
    - Crystallized Doom tanks

Air
    - Reduce Damage from small arms
    - Adjust speed
    - Helicopter movement, acceleration/deceleration
    - A10 freezes mid-air when out of gun-ammo and attack-moving with gun-only target in range
    - Tiberian Aurora Attack helicopter model, very nice almost too good

Structures
    - Trenches

Ammo
    - Costs money
    - Trucks need to be sent back

    - Units out of ammo rejects attack orders

Animations
    - TOS explosion effects
    - Projectiles "Disappearing" ouside northern edge
    - Colors are camouflage, not silly colors. Select from list instead, maybe even two colors. They could read half of the palette each?

Sounds
    - Voice
    - Firing
    - Explosions

Widgets
    - Move to edges, remove borders, free up space

Orders
    Attack Move should be default behaviour

    Q - Move
    W - Force Move (moves faster but has reduces detection, accuracy, firing rate etc)
    E - Fighting Retreat (Attack closest enemy but stay at maximum distance)
    R - Take Cover (multiple clicks increases search radius for controling how much they spread out)
    - Spread (change so they all move away from center / each other)

    Y - Deploy
    - Guard
    - Assault
    - Force Attack
    - Checkbox: Resupply

    Attacking
        - Sweeping, shooting at multiple enemies within one burst
        - Suppression trait, always prioritize units not taking cover

Stances (Check SetUnitStance)

    - Autotarget priorities

        - Enemy Economy Structures
        - All enemies
        - Only combatants (not structures, supply trucks etc)

        - Hold fire completely
    - Ammo preservation
        - Maximum firepower / Suppression
        - Preserve
        - Make every shot count
        - Checkbox: Auto Mode (reduce consumption dynamiccally when ammo is running low unless resupply is close by, this can be calculated dynamiccally based on how far away it is)
        - Checkbox: Resupply automatically
        - Checkbox: Ignore when resupplying
    - Cohesion
        - Tight (close as possible)

    - Formation
        - Line
        - Box
        - Column

            - Primary
            - Secondary
            - Tertiary

    "Use as default" - new units will use this, save between games (needs a button like "Save these for next game as default", so it doesn't override everytime)


Mines
    - Cloaking
    - Engineer demining

Add Ukraine faction

AI
    - Needs to learn to build Logistics centers and rearm
    - AutoAssign Actor Method
        - Single Actor can call this method to determine where to go, can be used by both AI and player as a stance. "Autoassign on idle"
    - Unit Builder Module
        - Looks at what enemy has.
        - Builds what is necessary, not just random.
        - Units define capabilities, and Builder Module determines what capabilities are needed.
    - Strategical Module
        - Designates targets and areas of interest. Oil, and where to defend/attack.
        - Designates new units to target locations and if needed transfers units between tactical groups.
    - Tactical Module
        - Coordinates units for each point of interest, spreads out and keeps a tactical formation.
    - Operational Module
        - Smaller squads move as one and attacks targets.
        - Individual units attack targets of high value etc.

End Game
    - Capturing enemy flag could start a countdown to victory so you cant have hidden units preventing victory and neglect your spawn
    - Time limited games ends with nuclear armageddon
        - Power "Nuclear escalation" that, if everyone uses it, the nuclear war begins with one nuke per player per 10s or something, game ends by points gathered before Armageddon
        - Everyone starts with a tactical nuke that counts down to the game end time, when it is reached anyone can fire but if they do they

- Shellmaps
    - "Bradley Square"
    - Piatykhatky Ukrainian offensive breakthrough

Div
    - Civ buildings give Base under attack notification
    - Buildings can have attack stance and that translates into what the default should be for units (that doesn't implement some kind of LockInitialStance Trait, or possibly OverrideAttackAllStance. Useful for spies I guess)
    - Spawn Aircraft/all units at full speed
    - Save last game settings and view a quick button to load the last one and also drop down

Futuristic
    - Shattered Paradise
        - Crusader infantry, mech suit
        - Animation militantfire, large fire TS.anim palette?
        - nahfact tall concrete building, looks like missile factory or something
        - armh vehicle, good tank chassis but needs rework
    - ACOL, cyber unit with laser...
