    Shadow casting

        Besides the classic Shroud, units can now hide behind actors spawned by SpawnMapActors that has the BlocksSight trait.

        - SpawnMapActors
            - Facilitates SetShadows, that calculates the ShadowLayers
            - Gets called when map actors are spawed for now
            - Improvement: Calculate when saving map?
            - Or: Calculate on the fly but only where its needed, and cache it.

        - Map
            - ShadowLayers stores all tiles and caches which tiles from that location will be shadowed.

        - AddSource()

        - RemoveSource()
