ShroudPalette

    - Dynamically create 100 or so palettes

ShroudRenderer

    - Loads the palette like: fogPaletteReference = wr.Palette(info.FogPalette);

    - Load palette depending on ShroudCellType (convert to int if Haze)

Shroud

    - resolvedType

Flow

    RevealsShroud: Determines how far is visible and Haze falloff
    Shroud: Resolved type is a dynamic value 1-100 from Fog to Visible
    -Renderer: Use resolved type to render dynamic palette


Problem

    The problem right now is that, even though each cell has the correct ResolvedVisibility set, when
        the ShroudRenderer renders, it:
            - Sets shroud everywhere that regenereates just like fog. This can be solved. But,
            - Even if there was fog in the right place, the changing of the palette makes squares
                and doesnt fade nicely like layers.

    The solution must be to go back to having multiple layers that fade nicely against eachother.
        - Should be possible, might be more expensive but if there is no other choice it must be done.
        - Must find how the border between layers are set and update their opacity to fade nicely.
