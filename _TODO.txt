2023

- Control groups

    - Leader units allow for more efficient grouping

        4       Fire Team       TL
        12      Squad           NCO
        30      Platoon         Liutenant
        100     Company         Captain
        500     Battalion       Liutenant Colonel

- Stances

    - HUNT          Spread out and search, converge and destroy enemy
    - HOLD GROUND   Defend current position and newarby friendly forces
    - AMBUSH        Only fire when exposed or if an ally close by is exposed, disable by double clicking when activating.
    - RETREAT       Stay at maximum range from enemy
    - HOLD FIRE     Neutral capturable objects, inefficient targets

- Movements / Formations

    - Move at max individual speed (how it is currently)
    - Move in formation

    - Close
    - Default
    - Far
    - Organized


- Announcements

    - Enemy detected


    - Check SetUnitStance
    - Buildings can have attack stance and that translates into what the default should be for units (that doesn't implement some kind of LockInitialStance Trait, or possibly OverrideAttackAllStance. Useful for spies I guess)
    - Formations
        - "Stay in formation", move in current configuration
        - Pre-defined formations
        - Check Autotarget and how stances are set there, do similar on Move/Mobile?
    - Units out of ammo rejects attack orders
    - Add announcements like "Enemy Detected"
    - UnitStance
        - Add more stances?
        - Stay at a distance
        - ReturnFire should trigger for nearby units too if one is discovered to enable ambushes.
        - Types
            - AUTHORIZED WEAPONS - primary, secondary, mg, tow, etc - each "name" gets it's own button, deselecting all means NO FIRE stance.
            - Default move is attack move, attack move renamed to "forced move"
            - COHESION: Stay close to more powerful (valuable) units
        - Multi-toggle stances, and each controls a specific behaviour
            - Fire at your main priority only (or ideally, skip if there is no such units even close)
            - Fire at furthest target / closest (avoids overkill on the front line)
            - Fire at closest or hunt down priority targets? A tank should move forward and attack a tank at the back instead of firing at simple infantry?
            - Target non-defensive/capturable structures?
            - Hunt down enemies (Autotarget: ScanRadius)
            - Keep away (turreted units fall back to max distance)
            - Auto Guard priority targets (Units are grouped together when enemy appears, tanks go forward, hunts down enemy, then will fall back to artillery units for example)
            - How do each state work with:
                - Move (And encountering enemy, should it cancel move order?)
                - Attack-move

- AI
    - Needs to learn to build Logistics centers and rearm
    - AutoAssign Actor Method
        - Single Actor can call this method to determine where to go, can be used by both AI and player as a stance. "Autoassign on idle"
    - Unit Builder Module
        - Looks at what enemy has.
        - Builds what is necessary, not just random.
        - Units define capabilities, and Builder Module determines what capabilities are needed.
    - Strategical Module
        - Designates targets and areas of interest. Oil, and where to defend/attack.
        - Designates new units to target locations and if needed transfers units between tactical groups.
    - Tactical Module
        - Coordinates units for each point of interest, spreads out and keeps a tactical formation.
    - Operational Module
        - Smaller squads move as one and attacks targets.
        - Individual units attack targets of high value etc.



Terrain
    - AllowedTerrain, LandableTerrainTypes, TerrainTypes, AllowedTerrainTypes


- Colors are camouflage, never silly colors. Select from list instead, maybe even two colors. They could read half of the palette each?

- Save last game settings and view a quick button to load the last one and also drop down

- Removed news, do same for Connect to forum, change release text
- Smoke tick needs to be reset to lower value again, they stay too long. Make more SHPs though

Movements
- Default to AttackMove
- AttackMove
    If moving away from enemy, consider it a retreat
        Stay at max distance from enemy but dont move out of sight
- ForceMove
    Units moves faster even under suppression but with limited abilities
- ForceAttack


AutoTarget
- Move within MaxRange of all Armament only on Defend, Attack Anything means autotarget with maxrange of lowest ranging weapon.
- Don't overkill
    If a unit fires a salvo, eg MLRS, if there is only one unit,
        dont shoot the whole salvo, instead sweep
- Sweeping, shooting at multiple enemies within one burst
- Retarget if there is a more valid target
- Add Weapon.Info.AverageDamage to override the default
- Multiple Turrets with different AutoTargeting
- Use other armament if reload for primary is long, humvee for example

- ShouldExplode on targets that get in the way, but it shouldnt stop autotargeting

- Shellmaps
    - "Bradley Square"
    - Piatykhatky Ukrainian offensive breakthrough

- Humvee in two versions, MG & TOW

- Infantry cloaking near trees not working? AI could shoot

- Bradleys too good vs infantry? Reduce spread?

- Inaccuracy scales logarithmically with distance


Unsolved bugs

    - E6 Repair and MineClearing doesn't work unless they have primary/secondary weapon name.
        - Different name works for C4, so can't see why it wouldn't work.
        - Solution now is to merge Vehicle/BuildingRepair to primary, MineClearing secondary, and the rest after that.
        - Actually, it seems like tertiary weapon doesn't work, is this for all units? Must one of the three be paused for the others to work perhaps? Because tertiary is a thing for many other units

- Units move towards enemy when attacking and being within their minrange, check and adjust for that case

- Helicopter husks on water should sink and disappear

- Slow down walk sequence to match locomotor speed on layer.

- ShouldExplode for some bullets could be simplified
    - Check once when firing and determine impact position,
        don't run BlockingActors check every tick, instead
        assume that if there are no blocking actors when shooting,
        there will be none entering firing arc during bullet flight.

- Multi-threading for performance, possible?
    - LogicTick / RenderTick on seperate threads?

- A10 freezes mid-air when out of gun-ammo and attack-moving with gun-only target in range

- Spawn Aircraft/all units at full speed

- Shroud update
    - Each cell has a visibility of 0-100, 0 = Shrouded, 100 = visible
    - Units have detection from 100 down to 0 based on distance.
        - AffectsShroud.UpdateShroudCells.AddCellsToPlayerShroud
            -> RevealShroudEffect.AddCellsToPlayerShroud -> player.Shroud.AddSource(this, sourceType, uv);
    - Units have camouflage 0-100 that makes them invisible at lower visibility

- Can't issue enter order on neutral cargo actors if shrouded
- TECN infiltrates cargo neutral structures instead of entering

UNIT:
    Visibility:
        Cloaking
        Spotted (GPS marker, can be targeted in limited mode)
        Revealed (Unit type identified, can be targeted fully)
        RadarSize
    Detection:
        Cloak ()
        Sight (Determines shroud effect)
        Radar

- Tesla tank returns to base when out of ammo

- Bleedout sequence doesnt show, unit disappears

- Airplanes doesnt spawn, helicopters spawn on ground

- Check Blocking actors from weapon offset not from center ground position

- Add Ukraine faction


- Engineer cant repair
    - Engineer can capture disabled vehicles?
- Vehicles gets disabled at 50% health
    - Add recovery vehicle that can tow vehicles
    - Change "Sell" to "Evacuate", units leave vehicle/building and it becomes neutral
- Buildings may require more than one technician to operate, enter as cargo until full before changing owner

- Units might surrender if surrounded, low experience
    - Defects if out of money and upkeep is high

- "quittable" instead of time limited. After X minutes any player can quit, and game will count score.
    When game ends both players get points based on how many units they have left, making it sometimes
    preferable to wait to get a better score. Nuclear armageddon mode starts waves of nuclear strikes
    that ends with all units being destroyed. No points are counted, unless one player is victorious
    everyione loses.

- MCV used as a construction/transport vehicle.
    - Goes to existing Conyard to load up.
    - Each unit has seperate build tab, using the Defense icon, placed first.
    - Other units can also have options that uses the same layout.
    - The unit is selected, the defense tab is automatically selected and the
        desired building can be "built" instantly. Choosing any other will
        replace the current one.
    - When going to the conyard, manually, it is loaded up and then it can
        go to the desired loacation and deploy like mainelayer. If multiple
        builds have been queued it will go back and re-load. When docked,
        it starts the loading process and builds the selected structure.
    - When done it becomes loaded and goes to the construction location.

- InfantryStates
    - Force move is "rush", increases speed by ~30% but reduces visual/detection
        - Also no auto fire, change normal move to be attack move.
        - Assault move can be when firing and running, with very limited accuracy.

- More on move types:
    - Normal move without modifier should be attack move, stop and fire if possible.
    - Hold alt for force move, faster speed but reduced detection. No auto fire at all?
        Or return fire perhaps? Move when not being supressed, otherwise return fire.

- Trenches

- Soldiers enter civilian buildings
    -

- Sounds for all units: Artillery

Bugs

Infantry

    - SF demolish should bring building to critical state + disabled until repaired

    - Show class at further zoom

    E6
        - Disarming mines replenishes C4 Ammo
        - Autotarget
        - Repair bridge should have a Delay
            - Check: RepairsBridges, Captures, CaptureManager, CaptureActor, Enter

    Flamethrower
        - Clear buildings, turning them into neutral

    Spy
        - AI shot with mortar when disguised and no other units that were closer seemed to notice?
        - Infiltrated Refinery gives % of earned cash until that refinery is destroyed/sold
            - Can be detected manually by looking at the money ticks?
        - Infiltrating production building makes all units from that building slower/damage less etc
        - Infiltrating the service depot destroys the next unit that is being serviced, or damages it slowly maybe?

    Sniper
        - Extra Hidden unless firing?

    Div
        - Resupply/Ammopool ReloadDelay should be renamed, ReloadDelay is used for reloading magazines
        - AI Conscripts starts to capture but seems to take squad orders and stops - decouple them from squad when they have opportunity to capture
            - Stop firing building that has been marked for capture
        - Multiple soldiers capturing building should make it faster, even if only one soldier enters at the end. Some buildings require more than one capturing soldier
        - Capturable harvesters, also if harvester is close to enemy units it will stop moving like it surrenders
        - Sell a building that you captured, you'll get your soldier back and not TECN
        - AI should put soldiers into defense buildings
        - Infantry should deploy immediately and not wait until at next position
        - Team Leaders that ranks up becomes a new unit like "Sergeant", "Lieutenant" etc, and when a unit is under the command of a team leader that is under the command of a sergeant it gives double bonus, and so on all the way to rank 4.

Vehicles
    - Fix opening sequence for btr80
    - Change M113 to AAVP7A1
    - Humvee can drive in forests now? Same size as infantry, uses subcells. Why?
    - Mines should not completely destroy heavy vehicles
    - Kamikaze drones
    - Crystallized Doom tanks

Aircraft
    - Soldiers in crashed transport helicopters have a small chance of surviving, but receive lots of damage.
    - Detection, Apache has StandardDetection now
    - Apache shouldn't use guns vs structures
    - 30mm.FighterGun still doesn't do any damage / misses?
        - offset seems to come from behind the aircraft
    - F16 doesn't fire auto or manually
    - Landed helicopters could have a bit longer visual
    - Mig vs apache very weak
    - Helicopters doesn't rearm when told to "repair", if helipad occupied. Probably true for all rearming
    - Aircraft returns to base if unit is killed, even if it has more ammo onboard
    * Russian Scout helicopter died over water and visuals remain?
    * Air bug, units unable to spawn if other unit is blocking waypoint
    - AI should use attack move for aircraft attacks
    - Slower when turning
    - Slow down when about to land and increase turn speed, so it doesn't overshoot and go in circles
    - Flying fortress range not working, hits short. Possibly launch angle
    - Helicopter rotors bigger?

Naval
    - Scale up
    - Cruise missiles that can be shot down
    - Change landing craft model

Defenses
    - GTUR cant force attack ground or own units
    - Attack priorities, prism tower should prioritize tanks
    - Deal damage to garrisoned soldiers as % of building damage, spread determines if killing multiple units or just one at a time
        - Show unit's health + ammo over the defense's health
    - Soldiers inside should be able to rearm, maybe even have automatic rearm / disable ammo drain
    - Crystallized Doom SAM launcher (NOD), also other cannons but looks a bit unrealistic

Structures

Support powers
    - Nukes
        - FlashPaletteEffect
            - Trait: AlphaBreakpoints [{255, 0}], Probably used something like { 50, 200, 0}
    - Aircraft powers direction, always from own side of the map so its more realistic and more predictable.
    - Modern Warfare B2 Bomber
    - Missile strike

DIV
    - Cancel attack order if running out of ammo, now they freeze
    - Render (some?) pips at further zoom
    - Allow infantry to move to and stop in subcells so that they can start firing faster, check in Move, Mobile, Locomotor, Order, MapGrid etc...
    - Pathfinder FindBidiPath, ignore units that are blocking, don't take detour around
    - Unit should cancel attack order if out of ammo for current target, now they just freeze while still aiming on target
    - Units in squad unable to attack a specific target should default back to attack move order not just move
    - Parallel queues keeps building units that are paused
    - Use ExplodeWhenEmpty from Missile to make Bullets also able to keep flying until they reach RangeLimit even if missing target (CRAM esp)
    - Load selection order - soldiers and vehicle in selection pairs up automatically
    - Suppression trait, always prioritize units not taking cover
    - Don't RevealShroud behind blocking actors
    - Building queue
        - Pause AND cancel all with one click by holding Ctrl
        - Cancel all of a production type by right clicking icon
        - Set infinite build by adding in same production after finishing each unit
        - Pausing speeds up other production just as if it was cancelled (infantry)
    - Ignore blocked bottlenecks. Ground units path finding ignores blocked path by allied units, doesn't take detour.
        - Units can overlap with allied forces, but are repulsed (borrow from aircraft logic)
    - War crimes demotes soldier

Ideas:
    - Dog Idea: Cant move only guard, + Wanders if not guarding
    - WEATHER - Change shroud to be called "Bad weather" or similar, Make it more like fog, slightly transparent but it hides all actors even with radar or gps etc
        - GAP should be smoke screen that dissipates
    - Manpower: Every player has a manpower number, every unit costs 1 or more manpower.
        - Periodically new manpower is added, and this can be used as a cap-limit to avoid huge conscript armies.
        - When a unit is sold, manpower is returned.
        - Civilian buildings captured spawns a number of (owned) civilians that can be ordered to a barracks to be "sold" for 0 cash but 1 manpower. Can then be turned into soldiers.
    - Engineer ground attack spawns mines (anti-personnel or tank or both?)
    - Time limited games ends with nuclear armageddon
        - Power "Nuclear escalation" that, if everyone uses it, the nuclear war begins with one nuke per player per 10s or something, game ends by points gathered before Armageddon
        - Everyone starts with a tactical nuke that counts down to the game end time, when it is reached anyone can fire but if they do they
    - Indirect fire weapons gain accuracy for each shot while target is stationary (and player has visual on the impact site)
    - Buildings are built by supply trucks that must drive back and forth from a conyard to fetch supplies and larger buildings require more deliveries.
    - Pontoon bridges
    - Change color of sprites so that only small parts of unit is part of player color palette. Armband for infantry, a marking for tanks / Aircraft. Should be enough
    - Nuclear powerplant, releases long lasting toxins if destroyed
    - Tooltip varies, if enemy to NATO use NATO Codename. Possibly use english version of foreign native names. "Strela" = Arrow. Nato codename "Gopher"

Good to know
    - Sequences that uses Facings: (negative) only uses half and reverses the rest? Seems so from other mod Shattered Paradise
