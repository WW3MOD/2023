    Shadow casting

        Parts

            - SpawnMapActors
                - Facilitates SetShadows, that calculates the ShadowLayers
                - Gets called when map actors are spawed for now
                - Improvement: Calculate when saving map?
                - Or: Calculate on the fly but only where its needed, and cache it.
            - Map.ShadowLayers, stores all tiles and which other tiles are shadowed from each
            - AddSource()
                - Uses Shadowlayers to
                - Reduces vision strength of the shadowed projectedCells of visibilityCount
                - Based on actor location

        - Cast shadows behind trees and buildings.

        - Use BlocksProjectiles? But would be cool if it was seperate so that we can add things as smoke with same effect
            - Add something like "Density" trait, that BlocksProjectile uses as default unless changed

        - Using Octagonal algorithm, copied from https://github.com/THEjoezack/ShadowCaster/blob/master/ShadowCaster/ShadowCaster.cs

        - At the first load every tile caches what vision looks like from there in a custom MapLayer

        - Set as a number, not boolean, as strength of the shadow / how tall and generally massive the blocking actor is
            - Different actors can see these differently?
            - Eg a drone should see better behind a building than a ground unit
            - Use this or a different number to set the mass of the object, that determines how

        - When drawing the combined vision from MapLayer, remove tiles that are in the shadows. (How most efficiently?)

        - Units with Vision trait defines their viewing height
            - If the view height is lower than the blocking height, it is completely blocked behind for as far as the unit can see
            - If the unit is looking from above the block height


    - Infantry speed slower, set 25 from 35
        - Make transports more important

    - Tanks / Vehicles reverse

Fix

    - Forest (or any tile with permanent vision modifier) shows up as lower vision in game.

    - Map editor
        - Add more civilian structures
        - Add more tiles, roads especially
        - Update / Create new maps


    - Default lobby options

    - Select units deprioritizes

    - Civ building
        - Units inside takes damage when building is hit.
        - When firing, the unit firing pops up as a pip for the enemy
        - Units can be selected one by one and with shift, marking them with a white outline
        - Pips gets larger when alt is held

    - Vehicles takes suppression, possibly stunned instead for a duration determined by the damage taken.
        - If the damage is large enough then derail vehicle as if driver was incapacitated for a bit

    - Shoot at last known location if losing track of target and it was stationary
        - When losing a target, keep it visible if any unit is still targeting it and has at least 1 vision

    - Suppression
        - Update using normal DamageWarhead,
            - Calculates suppression values at first run and caches them.
            - When Warhead makes impact, deal just as damage, based on range
        - Create custom using conditions? Set the condition directly, not using repeat?
        - a getter, updates when the warhead makes impakt

    - Protection based on tile / proximity. Show pips
        - Kinda done, do more testing
        - Remove object-proximity / merge with layer check.

    - Getting rank gives more bonuses, like becoming like a team leader. Team leader ranking up should get even more bonuses.

    - Add AimingTicks to Armament, and delay by that much before actually firing but must come after prepare attack

    - Iskander missile acceleration + balancing
    - New Himars missile, similar to Iskander but smaller and shorter range + balancing

Units

    - Humvee in two versions, MG & TOW
    - Add HandGrenade, IndirectFire

Bugs

Ideas

    Ammo
        - Units out of ammo should reject attack orders
        - Costs money
        - Trucks need to be sent back
        - Logistics centres needs delivery from supply trucks
        - Widget for auto rearm

    - Make infantry fire on the move
    - Force move is sprint
        - Normal move prioritizes moving in covered areas. Change pathfinder to prioritize cells with higher cover.
    - Attack move default

    - Change spread command to make units seek nearest high cover tile

    - Place Flags all around the map edges, chain-linking control gives access to deploy troops there, broken chain makes Flags disabled for calling in reinforcements.
        - Consider implementing a "per building" build queue (difficult?)

    - Binoculars / Laser designator for team leader.
        - If a force-attack is made on the ground, use Binoculars. Reveals area.
        - If force-attack is used on unit (only vehicles?), laser mark that unit.
        - Makes some missiles shoot further and also makes some, otherwise unguided, missiles use tracking.
        - Perfect for Himars / Iskander strikes.

    - When barely visible, show as GPS dot.
    - Enemy proximity adds to a condition, friendlies subtract. Total gives bonus/reduction in morale. Different units base their value to add on their combat value, that can also be used for other things (Capture domination etc)
    - The buildable units become more and more ranked the less of them you buy. Get only one type and all will be level 0, but build slowly and you can start recruiting even veterans (up to level 2?)

    - Entrance force, dropdown in time that players have before the game starts to use up their initial cash
        - Built units can only be moved within a small circle until timer is finished

    - Set a "tech increase" time when higher tech is allowed
    - Rename tech levels to something like "DEFCON" but more appropriate.
    - Rename "Build tree" to "Reservists"
    - Buildtime adjusted to be more like "callup time"

    - Helicopters when critically damaged "falls to earth" but slower, so you can control it but it loses altitude. When hitting ground, pilots evacuate and helicopter ChangesHealth until dead.

- Control groups
    - Leader units allow for more efficient grouping

        4       Fire Team       TL
        12      Squad           NCO
        30      Platoon         Liutenant
        100     Company         Captain
        500     Battalion       Liutenant Colonel

- Stances
    - UnitStance
        - Add more stances?
        - Stay at a distance
        - ReturnFire should trigger for nearby units too if one is discovered to enable ambushes.
        - Types
            - AUTHORIZED WEAPONS - primary, secondary, mg, tow, etc - each "name" gets it's own button, deselecting all means NO FIRE stance.
            - Default move is attack move, attack move renamed to "forced move"
            - COHESION: Stay close to more powerful (valuable) units
        - Multi-toggle stances, and each controls a specific behaviour
            - Fire at your main priority only (or ideally, skip if there is no such units even close)
            - Fire at furthest target / closest (avoids overkill on the front line)
            - Fire at closest or hunt down priority targets? A tank should move forward and attack a tank at the back instead of firing at simple infantry?
            - Target non-defensive/capturable structures?
            - Hunt down enemies (Autotarget: ScanRadius)
            - Keep away (turreted units fall back to max distance)
            - Auto Guard priority targets (Units are grouped together when enemy appears, tanks go forward, hunts down enemy, then will fall back to artillery units for example)
            - How do each state work with:
                - Move (And encountering enemy, should it cancel move order?)
                - Attack-move

    - HUNT          Spread out and search, converge and destroy enemy
    - HOLD GROUND   Defend current position and newarby friendly forces
    - AMBUSH        Only fire when exposed or if an ally close by is exposed, disable by double clicking when activating.
    - RETREAT       Stay at maximum range from enemy
    - HOLD FIRE     Neutral capturable objects, inefficient targets

- Movements / Formations
    - Move at max individual speed - How it is currently

    - Formations
        - "Stay in formation", move in current configuration
        - Pre-defined formations
        - Check Autotarget and how stances are set there, do similar on Move/Mobile?

Terrain
    - AllowedTerrain, LandableTerrainTypes, TerrainTypes, AllowedTerrainTypes

- Smoke tick needs to be reset to lower value again, they stay too long. Make more SHPs though

Movements

    - Default to AttackMove
    - AttackMove
        If moving away from enemy, consider it a retreat
            Stay at max distance from enemy but dont move out of sight
    - ForceMove
        Units moves faster even under suppression but with limited abilities
    - ForceAttack

AutoTarget
    - Move within MaxRange of all Armament only on Defend, Attack Anything means autotarget with maxrange of lowest ranging weapon.
    - Don't overkill
        If a unit fires a salvo, eg MLRS, if there is only one unit,
            dont shoot the whole salvo, instead sweep
    - Retarget if there is a more valid target
    - Add Weapon.Info.AverageDamage to override the default
    - Multiple Turrets with different AutoTargeting
    - Use other armament if reload for primary is long, humvee for example

- ShouldExplode on targets that get in the way, but it shouldnt stop autotargeting

- Inaccuracy scales logarithmically with distance

Unsolved bugs


- Units move towards enemy when attacking and being within their minrange, check and adjust for that case

- Helicopter husks on water should sink and disappear

- Slow down walk sequence to match locomotor speed on layer.

- ShouldExplode for some bullets could be simplified
    - Check once when firing and determine impact position,
        don't run BlockingActors check every tick, instead
        assume that if there are no blocking actors when shooting,
        there will be none entering firing arc during bullet flight.

- Multi-threading for performance, possible?
    - LogicTick / RenderTick on seperate threads?

- TECN infiltrates cargo neutral structures instead of entering

UNIT:
    Visibility:
        Cloaking
        Spotted (GPS marker, can be targeted in limited mode)
        Revealed (Unit type identified, can be targeted fully)
        RadarSize
    Vision:
        Cloak ()
        Sight (Determines shroud effect)
        Radar

- Bleedout sequence doesnt show, unit disappears

- Airplanes doesnt spawn, helicopters spawn on ground

- Check Blocking actors from weapon offset not from center ground position

- Engineer cant repair
    - Engineer can capture disabled vehicles?
- Vehicles gets disabled at 50% health
    - Add recovery vehicle that can tow vehicles
    - Change "Sell" to "Evacuate", units leave vehicle/building and it becomes neutral
- Buildings may require more than one technician to operate, enter as cargo until full before changing owner

- Units might surrender if surrounded, low experience
    - Defects if out of money and upkeep is high

- "quittable" instead of time limited. After X minutes any player can quit, and game will count score.
    When game ends both players get points based on how many units they have left, making it sometimes
    preferable to wait to get a better score. Nuclear armageddon mode starts waves of nuclear strikes
    that ends with all units being destroyed. No points are counted, unless one player is victorious
    everyione loses.

- MCV used as a construction/transport vehicle.
    - Goes to existing Conyard to load up.
    - Each unit has seperate build tab, using the Defense icon, placed first.
    - Other units can also have options that uses the same layout.
    - The unit is selected, the defense tab is automatically selected and the
        desired building can be "built" instantly. Choosing any other will
        replace the current one.
    - When going to the conyard, manually, it is loaded up and then it can
        go to the desired loacation and deploy like mainelayer. If multiple
        builds have been queued it will go back and re-load. When docked,
        it starts the loading process and builds the selected structure.
    - When done it becomes loaded and goes to the construction location.

Infantry
    - SF demolish should bring building to critical state + disabled until repaired
    - Show class at further zoom

    E6
        - Disarming mines replenishes C4 Ammo
        - Autotarget
        - Repair bridge should have a Delay
            - Check: RepairsBridges, Captures, CaptureManager, CaptureActor, Enter

    Flamethrower
        - Clear buildings, turning them into neutral


    Sniper
        - Extra Hidden unless firing?

    Div
        - Resupply/Ammopool ReloadDelay should be renamed, ReloadDelay is used for reloading magazines
        - AI Conscripts starts to capture but seems to take squad orders and stops - decouple them from squad when they have opportunity to capture
            - Stop firing building that has been marked for capture
        - Multiple soldiers capturing building should make it faster, even if only one soldier enters at the end. Some buildings require more than one capturing soldier
        - AI should put soldiers into defense buildings
        - Infantry should deploy immediately and not wait until at next position
        - Team Leaders that ranks up becomes a new unit like "Sergeant", "Lieutenant" etc, and when a unit is under the command of a team leader that is under the command of a sergeant it gives double bonus, and so on all the way to rank 4.

Vehicles
    - Fix opening sequence for btr80
    - Change M113 to AAVP7A1
    - Humvee can drive in forests now? Same size as infantry, uses subcells. Why?
    - Mines should not completely destroy heavy vehicles
    - Kamikaze drones

Aircraft
    - Soldiers in crashed transport helicopters have a small chance of surviving, but receive lots of damage.
    - Detection, Apache has StandardVision now
    - Apache shouldn't use guns vs structures
    - Helicopters doesn't rearm when told to "repair", if helipad occupied. Probably true for all rearming
    - Aircraft returns to base if unit is killed, even if it has more ammo onboard
    * Russian Scout helicopter died over water and visuals remain?
    * Air bug, units unable to spawn if other unit is blocking waypoint
    - AI should use attack move for aircraft attacks
    - Slower when turning
    - Slow down when about to land and increase turn speed, so it doesn't overshoot and go in circles
    - Flying fortress range not working, hits short. Possibly launch angle
    - Helicopter rotors bigger?

Naval
    - Scale up
    - Cruise missiles that can be shot down
    - Change landing craft model

Defenses
    - Attack priorities, prism tower should prioritize tanks
    - Deal damage to garrisoned soldiers as % of building damage, spread determines if killing multiple units or just one at a time
        - Show unit's health + ammo over the defense's health
    - Soldiers inside should be able to rearm, maybe even have automatic rearm / disable ammo drain
    - Crystallized Doom SAM launcher (NOD), also other cannons but looks a bit unrealistic

Support powers
    - Nukes
        - FlashPaletteEffect
            - Trait: AlphaBreakpoints [{255, 0}], Probably used something like { 50, 200, 0}
    - Aircraft powers direction, always from own side of the map so its more realistic and more predictable.
    - Modern Warfare B2 Bomber
    - Missile strike

DIV
    - Allow infantry to move to and stop in subcells so that they can start firing faster, check in Move, Mobile, Locomotor, Order, MapGrid etc...
    - Pathfinder FindBidiPath, ignore units that are blocking, don't take detour around
    - Unit should cancel attack order if out of ammo for current target, now they just freeze while still aiming on target
    - Units in squad unable to attack a specific target should default back to attack move order not just move
    - Parallel queues keeps building units that are paused
    - Use ExplodeWhenEmpty from Missile to make Bullets also able to keep flying until they reach RangeLimit even if missing target (CRAM esp)
    - Don't RevealShroud behind blocking actors
    - Ignore blocked bottlenecks. Ground units path finding ignores blocked path by allied units, doesn't take detour.
        - Units can overlap with allied forces, but are repulsed (borrow from aircraft logic)
    - War crimes demotes soldier

Ideas:
    - Dog Idea: Cant move only guard, + Wanders if not guarding
    - Indirect fire weapons gain accuracy for each shot while target is stationary (and player has visual on the impact site)
    - Pontoon bridges

Good to know
    - Sequences that uses Facings: (negative) only uses half and reverses the rest? Seems so from other mod Shattered Paradise
